<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

performing trajectory analysis to study transcriptomic changes during the differentiation of human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) using main tools SCORPIUS, TSCAN and Slingshot. Exploring differences among genetic-subtypes of PD through trajectory inference and simultaneous component analysis using ALASCA. Pdf report of the thesis is uploaded for reference 

Bird eye view of the project:
* Trajectory inference analysis, comparing various tool (Tool_Comparison.R)
* Extraction of pseudotime and linear modelling (Pseudotime_TI_LMM.R)
* ASCA modelling dataset formatting (ALASCA_dataset.R)
* ASCA modelling analysis (ALASCA_Analysis.R)
